# UAV Altitude Control System

This project implements a **PID Controller** to regulate the **altitude** of an **Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)** using **MATLAB** and **Simulink**. The model simulates altitude response under various conditions, including disturbances, to evaluate the controller's performance.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/UAV-Altitude-Controller.git
   ```

2. **Open the MATLAB Project:**
   - Launch MATLAB.
   - Open the Simulink model file (`PID_Altitude_control_for_UAV_2.slx`).

3. **Run the Simulation:**
   - Simulate the model to observe altitude response.
   - Adjust PID parameters for tuning, if necessary.

4. **Analyze Results:**
   - View simulation plots to analyze performance.
   - Evaluate the effect of disturbances.
